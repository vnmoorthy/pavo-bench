PAVO treats the voice-assistant pipeline as a jointly optimizable inference graph. An **85,041-parameter** meta-controller, trained with multi-objective PPO in **106 seconds on an H100**, decides per turn whether to route each ASR → LLM → TTS call to a cloud or edge configuration. The empirical contribution is a characterization of **inter-stage coupling constraints** — quality dependencies where upstream ASR choices bound what downstream LLMs can recover from.

**Authors:** NarasingaMoorthy VeiluKanthaPerumal (University of Pennsylvania) and Mohammed Imthathullah (Google).

**Status:** Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2026.

## Headline results

Direct experiments use NVIDIA H100 (Lambda Labs) and Apple M3 8 GB. The 50,000-turn routing evaluation is a simulation parameterized by those measurements and published benchmarks for unavailable A100/Jetson configurations.

| Metric | vs fixed-cloud baseline | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| P95 end-to-end latency (H100, LibriSpeech) | **−10.3%** (−167 ms) | — |
| Median latency | **−34%** | |
| Energy per turn | **−71%** | |
| Coherence-failure rate | **7.1% → 0.9%** (7.9× reduction) | hard-constraint masking, +110 ms median cost |
| Meta-controller size | 85,041 parameters | — |
| Meta-controller training | 106 seconds | — |

The reported `p = 2×10⁻⁶` is from the paired test of **mean** end-to-end latency (2,277 vs 2,671 ms over five bootstrap replications), not the descriptive P95 comparison. The paired Wilcoxon test on the same five replications gives `p = 0.0625`.

![Coupling cliff — downstream LLM quality vs upstream ASR WER](figures/coupling_cliff.png)

The paper characterizes two coupling regimes: a **sharp factual-accuracy cliff** and **gradual semantic degradation**. In the H100 calibration (n=200 per WER level per model), all three LLM families remain stable through 10% injected WER and degrade at 15–20%. PAVO uses 2% as a conservative safety threshold; it is not the measured H100 cliff location. Downstream LLM performance is therefore not independent of the upstream ASR configuration.

## Why this matters

Most voice-stack work optimizes ASR, LLM, and TTS independently. In practice, accuracy and latency of each stage interact: a noisy transcript pushes the LLM over a quality cliff, while an over-provisioned cloud route wastes energy on turns an edge model would have handled. PAVO provides:

1. **PAVO-Bench** — a 50K-turn voice interaction benchmark with complexity labels (40K train / 10K test), released on HuggingFace.
2. **A trained, tiny router** — 85K-parameter MLP that beats fixed-cloud on latency and energy while matching quality on coupling-safe turns.
3. **A reproducible coupling calibration** — 5,430 calibration measurements across two hardware platforms (H100, M3) and three LLM families (Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, Gemma2 2B) so you can reproduce the coupling cliff on your own model pair.

## Quickstart

### Python API (CPU, no ollama needed — ~30 s)

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vnmoorthy/pavo-bench.git
```

```python
from pavo_bench import (
    load_dataset, AlwaysCloudRouter, AlwaysEdgeRouter, HybridRouter,
    PretrainedPAVORouter, BaseRouter, benchmark_router,
)

turns = load_dataset(split="test")   # 10K test turns from HuggingFace
pavo  = PretrainedPAVORouter.from_released()  # 85K-param trained router

for R in [AlwaysCloudRouter(), AlwaysEdgeRouter(), HybridRouter(), pavo]:
    r = benchmark_router(R, turns)
    print(f"{r.router:<18s} P95={r.latency_ms_p95:>7.0f} ms   "
          f"quality={r.quality_mean:.3f}   energy={r.energy_mj_mean:>6.1f} mJ")
```

Write your own router in five lines by subclassing `BaseRouter` and returning one of `"cloud_premium"`, `"ondevice_fast"`, or `"hybrid_balanced"` from `.route(turn)`. See [`notebooks/quickstart.ipynb`](notebooks/quickstart.ipynb) (runs on free-tier Colab) or [`BLOG.md`](BLOG.md) for a walkthrough.

### Full reproduction (GPU + ollama)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vnmoorthy/pavo-bench.git
cd pavo-bench
bash experiments/setup.sh                  # installs torch, whisper, ollama + pulls llama3.1:8b and gemma2:2b

# Run all tiers without modifying the public artifact repository
python experiments/run_all_experiments.py --skip-upload

# Or run experiments individually
python experiments/exp1_e2e_pipeline.py          # End-to-end pipeline (Tier 2)
python experiments/exp2_coupling_calibration.py  # Coupling cliff (Tier 1, 5,430 measurements across H100/M3 × Llama/Mistral/Gemma)
python experiments/exp3_train_ppo.py             # PPO meta-controller training (~106 s on H100)
python experiments/exp4_real_ablation.py         # Component ablation with BERTScore
```

Training-only reproduction runs in **~2 minutes** on a single H100. A full reproduction of all tiers takes roughly half a day on an H100 including ollama warm-up and LibriSpeech downloads.
