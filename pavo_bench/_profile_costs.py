"""Per-profile latency/quality/cost/energy priors extracted from the committed
tier2_e2e_results.json and component_ablation_results.json.

benchmark_router uses these to turn a router's per-turn profile choice into an
aggregate metrics dict without requiring the user to spin up an LLM + ASR
stack. The hybrid quality/cost/energy entries are documented stand-ins, so this
module supports API demonstrations rather than camera-ready metric replay.
